TODO:
[x] Delete old files
[x] Train on price increase and decrease.
[ ] Incorporate backtesting.py
[ ] The model is trained to predict on a price rise in n days. We should save the order in a list of completed orders, and when the order reaches the predicted training date, we should sell, or check to see if we are in the black and sell
[ ] Save all orders to csv so we can see what we made on each one?
[ ] train the INC value on hitting the take profit mark
[ ] train the DEC value on hitting the stop loss mark.
[ ] fix issue where orders are not closed out. First order closes and the loop doesnt continue
