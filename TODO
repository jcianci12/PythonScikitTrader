TODO:
[x] Delete old files
[x] Train on price increase and decrease.
[ ] Incorporate backtesting.py
[ ] The model is trained to predict on a price rise in n days. We should save the order in a list of completed orders, and when the order reaches the predicted training date, we should sell, or check to see if we are in the black and sell
[ ] Start testing with tp and sl on orders. - not working...
[ ] Save all orders to csv so we can see what we made on each one?
    create an order
    get the order ID upon creation
    create two more orders, one for take profit and one for stop loss,
    save all those order IDs with their details to a csv called orders. Also save the take profit and stop loss price. Include the tag Open on the row so we know its open
    When the market hits either the take profit or stop loss price, excecute the applicable order to close the position.
    Compare the buy value and the sell value to create a profit column. update the row with the profit.
