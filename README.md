# PythonScikitTrader
Thanks for checking out my project!

What this project does:
- Demonstrates how to interface with the bybit exchange (sometimes the bybit documentation was a bit sparse - there is some trial and error in here)
- Demonstrates in a not so elegant way how RN, KNN, and Ensemble model classifiers can be trained
- Auto trades the BTCUSDT spot pair on bybit unified exchange
- Produces signals based on training data for a +5 price increase or a -5 increase
- Uses those signals to buy or sell
- Produces a performance graph showing the btc close price, the signals, and the portfoio balance
- Includes some python unit tests for checking connection to the exchange (these tests could really be improved quite a bit)

What this project probably doesnt do:
- Make money ðŸ¤£
- Give good indicators (seems like training phase seems to give about a 60% success rate)
- Time the market very well... 

What I would love this project to do:
- Update the models more efficiently - currently it is fetching all historic data and training on all the data every 60 minutes instead of just updating the models with the newest data
- Incorporate backtest.py so that I can, well... backtest!

Startup guide (how im doing it on a windows machine)
- Get vscode
- Clone this project from vscode
- You should get an option pop up after clonine - something to the effect - would you like to open this in a container?
- Click reopen in container
- Once that is done, add a KEYS.py file and use the KEYS Template.py as a starting guide.
- Open train and test and top right you should have the option to run/run and debug. Click that
- If all goes to plan, here is what it does:
- Fetches historical data
- Trains on the data
- Every 5 mins, makes a prediction, buy, sell or hold
- Calculates buy and sell percent based on available capital
- Saves the performance data in a csv and plots a graph
- If you want to change any of the settings, as well as switch over to use the bybit test exchange API, just change TEST in config.py to True
